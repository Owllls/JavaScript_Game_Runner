	  <p>Tetris (Russian: Тетрис [ˈtɛtrʲɪs]; from "tetromino" and "tennis")
	  is a tile-matching puzzle video game originally designed and programmed
	  by Soviet Russian game designer Alexey Pajitnov (Russian: Алексе́й Леони́дович Па́житнов).
	  [1] The first playable version was completed on June 6, 1984,[2] while he was working
	  for the Dorodnitsyn Computing Centre of the Academy of Science of the Soviet Union in Moscow.
	  [3] He derived its name from the Greek numerical
	  prefix tetra- (all of the game's pieces contain four segments) and tennis, Pajitnov's favorite sport.

	   <div class="b"><span onclick="change()">Tank (gaming)</span>
	  <p>A tank (sometimes referred to as a meat shield) is a style of
	  character in gaming, often associated with a character class.
	  A common convention in real-time strategy games, role-playing
	  games, fighting games, multiplayer online battle arenas and MUDs,
	  tanks redirect enemy attacks or attention toward themselves in order
	  to protect other characters or units. Since this role often requires
	  them to suffer large amounts of damage, they rely on large amounts of
	  vitality or armor, healing by other party members, evasiveness and misdirection,
	  or self regeneration. Tank units are typically represented as
	  large and strong, sometimes heavily armored as well.[citation needed]
      In games where players are classified in "leagues," as in Walking War Robots,
	  a "tanker" is a player that intentionally loses rank to pass in lower-level
	  leagues to have more easy access to rewards.

	  <p>Rules  
	  The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite, two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square
	  cells, each of which is in one of two possible states, alive or dead, (or populated and unpopulated, respectively). Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions occur:
      Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
      Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
      Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
      Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
      The initial pattern constitutes the seed of the system. The first generation
	  is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the seed; births
	  and deaths occur simultaneously, and the discrete moment at which this happens is
	  sometimes called a tick. Each generation is a pure function of the preceding one. 
	  The rules continue to be applied repeatedly to create further generations.

	  <p>Mario (Japanese: マリオ Hepburn: Mario, pronounced [ma.ɾi.o]; English: /ˈmɑːrioʊ, ˈmær-/; Italian:
	  [ˈmaːrjo]) is a fictional character in the Mario video game franchise, owned by Nintendo and created by 
	  Japanese video game designer Shigeru Miyamoto. Serving as the company's mascot and the eponymous protagonist
	  of the series, Mario has appeared in over 200 video games since his creation. Depicted as a short, pudgy, 
	  Italian plumber who resides in the Mushroom Kingdom, his adventures generally center upon rescuing Princess
	  Peach from the Koopa villain Bowser. His younger brother and sidekick is Luigi.
      With more than 500 million units sold worldwide, the overall Mario franchise is the best-selling video game
	  franchise of all time.[1][2] Outside of the Super Mario platform series, other Mario genres include the Mario
	  Kart racing series, sports games such as the Mario Tennis and Mario Golf series, role-playing games such as Mario
	  & Luigi, Super Mario RPG and Paper Mario, and educational games such as Mario Is Missing!, Mario's Time Machine
	  and Mario Teaches Typing. The franchise has branched into several media, including television shows, film, comics,
		  and licensed merchandise. Since 1990, Mario has been voiced by Charles Martinet
